                                        keeps a record of the archives and checksums that are generated from those archives. The SHA256SUMS files is used to delete old archives and add new ones (which are removed and appended to SHA256SUMS). The number
                                        of kept archives depending on the parameter N that tells the script how many to keep. The script runs daily using crontab using whatever options the user specified.</td>

                                        Same programming logic applies but it does get more complicated then normal programming at times since you are working with real electronics and there are different rules that apply such as not being able to change

                                    junior and all of senior year and ended up graduating a month early. The point of me mentioning that is to show I work hard, especially under pressure. Now I study computer science and want to get into software engineering.
                                    I am very iteresting in blockchain technology and AI. I am most comfortable with C++ but I'm a fast learner and can pick up on other languages quite easily. I was originally going to major in animation so I do have
                                    experience with the 3d art side of games and some experience with Unity.<br><br></p>
